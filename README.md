## Abstract of the course:

Deep Learning is a new approach in Machine Learning which allows to build models that have shown superior performance fora wide range of applications, in particular Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Thanks to the joint availability of large data corpus and affordable processing power, Deep Learning has revived the old field  of Artificial Neural Networks and provoked the "Renaissance" of AI (Artificial Intelligence). The objective of this course is to provide an overview of the field of Deep Learning, starting from simple Neural Network architectures and pursuing with contemporary and state of the art practices and models. The course is organized as a combination of  lectures where the theory is exposed and discussed, and hands-on sessions (labs) where experimentations are performed to practice with the theoretical concepts.
