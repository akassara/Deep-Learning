During this lab session, we will implement, train and test a Neural Network for the Handwritten Digits Recognition problem with different settings of hyperparameters. We will use the MNIST dataset which was constructed from scanned documents available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centered.
