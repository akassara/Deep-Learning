# CNN for Handwritten Digits:
In the last Lab Session, we built a Multilayer Perceptron for recognizing hand-written digits from 
the MNIST data-set. The best achieved accuracy on testing data was about 97%. Is it possible to
do better than these results using a deep CNN ? In this Lab Session, we will build, train and 
optimize in TensorFlow one of the early Convolutional Neural Networks, LeNet-5, to go to more than 99% of accuracy.
